## Page Purpose
The purpose of this page is to give a glimpse into what I like to do in my free time.

Currently the hobbies that I will talk about are retro repair, baking/cooking, and magic the gathering. I am not sure if MTG is that visual to show but it might be an interesting challenge. I also want to explain why I like those hobbies and what skills they can demonstrate by talking about them.

### Retro Repair
- Retro repair and why I like it
- Sega Gamegear
- What are the components involved

### Baking/Cooking
#### Outline
- List a dish that I want to talk about. Most likely: Arroz con Polo
- List the recipe
- Write about the dish.

### MTG Deck
#### Outline
- Quick summary of Magic and what I like about it. 
- Then show a decklist using a table.
- Talk about Pauper and why I like it.
- What skills am I using?
