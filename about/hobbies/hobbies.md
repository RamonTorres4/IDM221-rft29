## Page Purpose
The purpose of this page is to give a glimpse into what I like to do in my free time.

Currently the hobbies that I will talk about are retro repair, baking/cooking, and magic the gathering. I am not sure if MTG is that visual to show but it might be an interesting challenge. I also want to explain why I like those hobbies and what skills they can demonstrate by talking about them.
