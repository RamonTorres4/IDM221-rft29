            <img src="#" alt="#">
            <p>Cooking is not only a really fun hobby but it's a great way to
                feed myself and my family. I enjoy the thrill of cooking and
                making something new. I not only love the successes but the
                "happy little accidents" from following a recipe that I have
                never made before.</p>
            <p>I learned how to cook as a teenager, my mom taught me how to make
                pasta with a can of tomato paste, sauce, sausage, and
                seasonings. I'm glad she did because the very first time I tried
                to cook potatoes, I sliced them and the put them into the
                microwave. Needless to say, I did not eat those potatoes. Here
                is one of my favorite recipes that I like to share and make.
                Since I am of Puerto Rican descent, cooking for me is a way to
                practice my culture.</p>

            <img src="#" alt="#">
            <p>Growing up in the late 90s, I was a big fan of having several
                gameboys because they were always fun to play and I could take
                them anywhere on the go.</p>
            <p>One of the problems with them was the awful screens. You would
                have to be glued to a lamp or get an adapter to help illuminate
                the screens for you to play at night, which is when I got to
                play as a kid.</p>
            <p>A few years ago, I was going through some of my old things in my
                parent's basement and I found my old gameboy. It bought back so
                many memories and I wanted to play with it again. Sadly it did
                not turn on and I decided to look into what I could do to fix
                it. This turned into a fixation and a hobby.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Gameboy Color</h2>
                <p><img src="#" alt="#"></p>
                <p>When doing research on my gameboy that didn't turn on, I
                    disovered that there was a whole world of different repairs
                    and modifications that I could do to give my gameboy color
                    new life. I decided to do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get a new shell and buttons</li>
                    <li>Install a brand new IPS screen</li>
                    <li>Install a new speaker</li>
                    <li>Remove corossion from the motherboard.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="mtg">Magic the Gathering</h2>
            <p><img src="#" alt="#"></p>
            <p>One of my favorite ways to spend time with friends is to play
                different games. Out of all of the games that I play is Magic
                the Gathering. I love playing magic for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's a very social game, so I can get out of the house and
                    see people.</li>
                <li>There are many different ways to play, with thought put into
                    how you want to approach the game, including Aggressive,
                    Control, or Combo.</li>
                <li>It can be very methodical in the way that you play, which is
                    how I play.</li>
                <li>There are many ways to play magic, all of them being
                    inventive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One of the formats that I play is called Pauper. It's a way of
                playing Magic on the cheap, only using commons to make up your
                deck. Not only is it cheap, but since there aren't any huge
                power imbalances, you can be more stragetic.</p>
            <p>I wanted to share one of the decks that I have created. It's
                called Dimir Terror. It has a control playstyle with something
                called tempo mixed in. The way you play the deck is that you use
                your Soceries and Instants to help you gain advantage and keep
                your opponent from achieving their game plan. When your
                graveyard fills up, you can take advantage by using the
                creatures in you deck, Tolarian Terror which it's casting cose
                is reduced the more Soceries and Instants are in the graveyard,
                and Gurmag Angler can use those cards and exile them from your
                graveyard to reduce it's casting cost.</p>
            <p>Lastly, since this deck likes to draw a lot of cards, the final
                creature, Sneaky Snacker, can be played from the graveyard if
                you draw more than two cards a turn.</p>
