    <img src="#" alt="#">
    <p>I learned how to cook as a teenager, my mom taught me how to make pasta with a can of tomato paste, sauce, sausage, and seasonings. I'm glad she did because the very first time I tried to cook potatoes, I sliced them and the put them into the microwave. Needless to say, I did not eat those potatoes.</p>

    <img src="#" alt="#">
    <p>Growing up in the late 90s, I was a big fan of having several gameboys because they were always fun to play and I could take them anywhere on the go.</p>
    <p>One of the problems with them was the awful screens. You would have to be glued to a lamp or get an adapter to help illuminate the screens for you to play at night, which is when I got to play as a kid.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, I was going through some of my old things in my parent's basement and I found my old gameboy. It bought back so many memories and I wanted to play with it again. Sadly it did not turn on and I decided to look into what I could do to fix it. This turned into a fixation and a hobby.</p>

        <h2>Gameboy Color</h2>
        <p><img src="#" alt="#"></p>
        <p>When doing research on my gameboy that didn't turn on, I disovered that there was a whole world of different repairs and modifications that I could do to give my gameboy color new life. I decided to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get a new shell and buttons</li>
            <li>Install a brand new IPS screen</li>
            <li>Install a new speaker</li>
            <li>Remove corossion from the motherboard.</li>
        </ul>
