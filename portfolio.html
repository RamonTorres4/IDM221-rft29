    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Here's my portfolio. Most of my work in Photography and Videography but I
      have some background in motion graphics.</p>

      <h3>Diorama Renovation</h3>
      <p><img src="#" alt="#"></p>
      <p>In 2023, The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University was able
        to clean and freshen up some of the dioramas that have been around since
        1933. The photos that I have are from the finished and cleaned dioramas
        without the glass on. The glare with the lighting in the hall really
        kills a lot of good photos, so I made sure to get as many good photos as
        I could.</p>

      <h3>Members Night</h3>
      <p><img src="#" alt="#"></p>
      <p>Members' Night is a night that the Academy offers to it's members once
        a year. It's a fantastic event where the museum opens up the research
        areas and scientists can show off their incredible work and research to
        members.</p>
      <p>I've worked Members' Night over the years, and I have captured some
        really great images that really shows off the collection. Here are some
        of my favorites.</p>

      <h3>Halloween Animations</h3>
      <p>In 2019, I challenged myself to make 31 different animations for each
        day of October, leading up to Halloween. It was a tough experience to
        have one done for each day and to make something creative. Overall it
        was a fun and challenging experience. Here are some of my favorite.</p>
