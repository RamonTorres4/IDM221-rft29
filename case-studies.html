            <h2>Plastic-free Philly</h2>
            <p><em>Summer of 2023</em></p>
            <p>During my time as the web and social media assistant, I was
                tasked with a project that would help launch the marketing
                campaign, plastic free philly. The project was far from simple.
                It involved 10 different artists with all different art styles.
                A video was created for each art installation which were around
                philadelphia. The goal of this project was to get people to
                reduce their use of single use plastic consumption.</p>
            <p>My role in this was to work with our director of marketing to
                interview, film, and edit these artists to show their
                projects.</p>

                <p><img src="#" alt="#"></p>
            </div>
            <p>I worked with some really great artists with so many varying
                backgrounds. It was incredible to work with so many talented
                people and see what wonderful things they can do.</p>

            <h2>ANS Website Redesign</h2>
            <p><em>July-Current</em></p>
            <p>I am working on a website redesign for the Academy of Natural
                Sciences of Drexel University's new site. I am doing this in a software called Sitecore Gold. This is a content management system which allows me to quickly and effeciently add or remove components depening on what is needed for specific pages.</p>
                <p>My portion of the project is to manage and impement the different components to build a working site that helps accomplish the institution's mission. My tasks include the following:</p>
                <ul>
