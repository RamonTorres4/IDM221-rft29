I am a photographer, videographer, and web content manager for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. I've been working in museums for as long as I can remember. I started when I was 13 years old as a volunteer working with animals and now I do so much more.

As a graduate from Community College of Philadelphia, I honed my skills of photography and videography. I took night classes at Moore, College of Art, getting my certification and learning about motion graphics and design. Now I am currently a student of Drexel University, working on completing my bachelor's degree.

I love visual arts but my passion is photography and videography. I love creating wonderful images by using lighting to get different effects. In my day job, I don't get to do a lot of creative lighting work but when I do, it's a fun challenge.
