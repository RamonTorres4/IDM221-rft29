### Plastic Free Philly
Summer of 2023
During my time as the web and social media assistant, I was tasked with a project that would help launch the marketing campaign, plastic free philly. The project was far from simple. It involved 10 different artists with all different art styles. A video was created for each art instilation which were around philadelphia. The goal of this project was to get people to reduce their use of single use plastic consumption.

My role in this was to work with our director of marketing to interview, film, and edit these artists to show their projects.

Here are a few of the examples.
